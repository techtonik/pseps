Abstract
========

This PSEP describes the support of PyQt's new-style signals and slots in
PySide. Traditionally PyQt, and by extension PySide, has required the
use of C++ function signature strings in connecting signals to slots.
This has been widely regarded as unwieldy and non-Pythonic. A new-style
signal and slot support was introduced in PyQt 4.5, in which the signals
and slots may be manipulated using native Python objects and methods.
This new syntax will be adopted to PySide with minor modifications.

Rationale
=========

The PyQt's traditional syntax for signals and slots requires the use of
explicit C++ style signal signatures [#old-style-signals]_. This has
been regarded as unwieldy and non-Pythonic feature and an opportunity
for improvement in the syntax. 

A new-style signal and slot syntax has been introduced in PyQt 4.5
[#new-style-signals]_. The new style provides a clean syntax to connect
signals and slots using Python objects and methods instead of C++ style
signature strings. An example of connecting and emitting signals using
the new-style syntax is given below (adapted from [#new-style-signals]_)::

    class Foo(QtCore.QObject):

        # Define a new signal called 'trigger' that has no arguments.
        trigger = QtCore.pyqtSignal()

        def connect_and_emit_trigger(self):
            # Connect the trigger signal to a slot.
            self.trigger.connect(self.handle_trigger)

            # Emit the signal.
            self.trigger.emit()

        def handle_trigger(self):
            # Show that the slot has been called.

            print "trigger signal received"

PyQt's new-style signal and slot mechanism provides a clean, concise,
and Pythonic syntax for defining, connecting, disconnecting, and
emitting signals.  To maintain compatibility with PyQt, their new-style
signal and slot mechanism will be adopted to PySide with minor
modifications only.

New Signal and Slot Syntax
==========================

PySide will adopt PyQt's new signal and slot syntax as-is. The PySide
implementation will be functionally compatible with the PyQt 4.5 one, with
the exceptions listed in the next Section. As PyQt compatibility will be
the main guideline, the syntax specifics will not be described here.
Instead, PyQt behaviour and documentation [#new-style-signals]_ shall be
used as implementation guidelines.

Differences from PyQt's syntax
==============================

PyQt's new signal and slot style utilizes method and decorator names
specific to their implementation. These will be generalized according to
the table below:

=======  ======================  =============
Module   PyQt factory function   PySide class
=======  ======================  =============
QtCore   pyqtSignal              Signal
QtCore   pyqtSlot                Slot
=======  ======================  =============

In addition to the generalized class names, PyQt factory names will be
provided as a compatibility feature. They will print out a deprecation
warning, however.

On the mailing list discussion, concerns were raised about the proposed
naming scheme. One issue was the risk of Qt implementing similarly named
C++ classes, resulting in name clashes in PySide.  However, the risk may
be regarded minor during the lifespan of Qt version 4, especially now
that the signals and slots are classes and are written in the
capitalized form. Even in the case this would happen, the issue could be
circumvented in PySide by renaming the new C++ classes suitably.

Another issue raised was the similarity of ``Signal`` and ``SIGNAL`` (as
well as ``Slot`` and ``SLOT``) class and function names in QtCore. While
the similarity is undeniably an issue, it could still be argued that the
case difference is substantial enough to minimize any risk of confusion
in practice. It could be argued that the non-Pythonic all-caps spelling
refers to the old-style signals and slots, while the standard spelling
refers to the Pythonic new-style signals.

Compatibility
=============

Since the new signal and slot syntax does not break compatibility with
the previous syntax, it will be implemented both as part of the original
and the possible future PySide API.

Hugo Lima, Mark Summerfield, Ville M. Vainio, Paul A. Giannaros, and
Douglas Soares de Andrade have contributed in the initial discussion of
this PSEP.

After having the PSEP already accepted, Hugo Lima pointed out a naming
scheme inconsistency, which caused the PSEP to be redrawn to the draft
status to have the classes properly capitalized.
