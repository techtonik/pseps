What is a PSEP?
===============

PSEP stands for PySide Enhancement Proposal.  A PSEP is a design
document providing information to the PySide community, or describing
a new feature for PySide or its processes or environment.  The PSEP
should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a
rationale for the feature.

We intend PSEPs to be the primary mechanisms for proposing new
features, for collecting community input on an issue, and for
documenting the design decisions that have gone into PySide.  The PSEP
author is responsible for building consensus within the community and
documenting dissenting opinions.

Because the PSEPs are maintained as text files in a versioned
repository, their revision history is the historical record of the
feature proposal [1]_.

The whole PSEP process has been copied verbatim from Python's PEP
(Python Enhancement Proposal) process, and this document has been
adapted to PSEP by Matti Airas from PEP 1 by Barry Warsaw, Jeremy
Hylton, and David Goodger.

PSEP Types
==========

There are three kinds of PSEP:

1. A **Standards Track** PSEP describes a new feature or implementation
   for PySide.

2. An **Informational** PSEP describes a PySide design issue, or
   provides general guidelines or information to the PySide community,
   but does not propose a new feature.  Informational PSEPs do not
   necessarily represent a PySide community consensus or
   recommendation, so users and implementors are free to ignore
   Informational PSEPs or follow their advice.

3. A **Process** PSEP describes a process surrounding PySide, or
   proposes a change to (or an event in) a process.  Process PSEPs are
   like Standards Track PSEPs but apply to areas other than the PySide
   itself.  They may propose an implementation, but not to
   PySide's codebase; they often require community consensus; unlike
   Informational PSEPs, they are more than recommendations, and users
   are typically not free to ignore them.  Examples include
   procedures, guidelines, changes to the decision-making process, and
   changes to the tools or environment used in Python development.
   Any meta-PSEP is also considered a Process PSEP.


PSEP Work Flow
==============

The PSEP editors assign PSEP numbers and change their status.  The
current PSEP editor is Matti Airas.  Please send
all PSEP-related email to <pyside@lists.openbossa.org> (no cross-posting please).
Also see `PSEP Editor Responsibilities & Workflow`_ below.

The PSEP process begins with a new idea for PySide.  It is highly
recommended that a single PSEP contain a single key proposal or new
idea.  The more focussed the PSEP, the more successful it tends to
be.  The PSEP editor reserves the right to reject PSEP proposals if they
appear too unfocussed or too broad.  If in doubt, split your PSEP into
several well-focussed ones.

Each PSEP must have a champion -- someone who writes the PSEP using the
style and format described below, shepherds the discussions in the
appropriate forums, and attempts to build community consensus around the
idea.  The PSEP champion (a.k.a. Author) should first attempt to
ascertain whether the idea is PSEP-able.  Posting to the
pyside@lists.openbossa.org mailing list is recommended.  Enhancements not
resulting in API changes usually don't need a PSEP and can be injected
into the PySide development work flow with a patch submission to the
PySide `issue tracker`_.

The PSEP champion then emails the PSEP editor <pyside@lists.openbossa.org> with a
proposed title and a rough, but fleshed out, draft of the PSEP.  This
draft must be written in PSEP style as described below.

If the PSEP editor approves, he will assign the PSEP a number, label it
as Standards Track, Informational, or Process, give it status "Draft",
and create and check-in the initial draft of the PSEP.  The PSEP editor
will not unreasonably deny a PSEP.  Reasons for denying PSEP status
include duplication of effort, being technically unsound, not providing
proper motivation or addressing backwards compatibility, or not in
keeping with the PySide philosophy.  The TBC (Temporary Benevolent
Committee, consisting of the core dev team and Matti Airas) can be consulted
during the approval phase, and is the final arbiter of the draft's
PSEP-ability.

If a pre-PSEP is rejected, the author may elect to take the pre-PSEP to
the pyside@lists.openbossa.org mailing list to help flesh it out, gain feedback
and consensus from the community at large, and improve the PSEP for
re-submission.

The author of the PSEP is then responsible for posting the PSEP to the
community forums, and marshaling community support for it.  As updates
are necessary, the PSEP author can check in new versions if they have
SVN commit permissions, or can email new PSEP versions to the PSEP
editor for committing.

Standards Track PSEPs consist of two parts, a design document and a
reference implementation.  The PSEP should be reviewed and accepted
before a reference implementation is begun, unless a reference
implementation will aid people in studying the PSEP.  Standards Track
PSEPs must include an implementation -- in the form of code, a patch,
or a URL to same -- before it can be considered Final.

PSEP authors are responsible for collecting community feedback on a PSEP
before submitting it for review.  A PSEP that has not been discussed on
python-list@python.org and/or python-dev@python.org will not be
accepted.  However, wherever possible, long open-ended discussions on
public mailing lists should be avoided.  Strategies to keep the
discussions efficient include: setting up a separate SIG mailing list
for the topic, having the PSEP author accept private comments in the
early design phases, setting up a wiki page, etc.  PSEP authors should
use their discretion here.

Once the authors have completed a PSEP, they must inform the PSEP editor
that it is ready for review.  PSEPs are reviewed by the TBC, who may
accept or reject a PSEP or send it back to the author(s) for revision.
For a PSEP that is pre-determined to be acceptable (e.g., it is an
obvious win as-is and/or its implementation has already been checked in)
the TBC may also initiate a PSEP review, first notifying the PSEP
author(s) and giving them a chance to make revisions.

For a PSEP to be accepted it must meet certain minimum criteria.  It
must be a clear and complete description of the proposed enhancement.
The enhancement must represent a net improvement.  The proposed
implementation, if applicable, must be solid and must not complicate the
interpreter unduly.  Finally, a proposed enhancement must properly
balance the "pythonicity" and "Qt-likeness" in order to be accepted by
the TBC.  (However, "pythonic" and "Qt-likeness" are imprecise terms;
they may be defined as whatever is acceptable to the TBC.  This logic is
intentionally circular.)

Once a PSEP has been accepted, the reference implementation must be
completed.  When the reference implementation is complete and accepted
by the TBC, the status will be changed to "Final".

A PSEP can also be assigned status "Deferred".  The PSEP author or
editor can assign the PSEP this status when no progress is being made
on the PSEP.  Once a PSEP is deferred, the PSEP editor can re-assign it
to draft status.

A PSEP can also be "Rejected".  Perhaps after all is said and done it
was not a good idea.  It is still important to have a record of this
fact.

PSEPs can also be replaced by a different PSEP, rendering the original
obsolete.  This is intended for Informational PSEPs, where version 2 of
an API can replace version 1.

The possible paths of the status of PSEPs are as follows:

.. image:: psep-0001-1.png

Some Informational and Process PSEPs may also have a status of "Active"
if they are never meant to be completed.  E.g. PSEP 1 (this PSEP).


What belongs in a successful PSEP?
==================================

Each PSEP should have the following parts:

1. Preamble -- RFC 822 style headers containing meta-data about the
   PSEP, including the PSEP number, a short descriptive title (limited
   to a maximum of 44 characters), the names, and optionally the
   contact info for each author, etc.

2. Abstract -- a short (~200 word) description of the technical issue
   being addressed.

3. Copyright/public domain -- Each PSEP must either be explicitly
   labelled as placed in the public domain (see this PSEP as an
   example) or licensed under the `Open Publication License`_.

4. Specification -- The technical specification should describe the
   syntax and semantics of any new API feature.  The
   specification should be detailed enough to allow competing,
   interoperable implementations for any of the current Python Qt
   bindings.

5. Motivation -- The motivation is critical for PSEPs that want to
   change the PySide API.  It should clearly explain why the
   existing API is inadequate to address the
   problem that the PSEP solves.  PSEP submissions without sufficient
   motivation may be rejected outright.

6. Rationale -- The rationale fleshes out the specification by
   describing what motivated the design and why particular design
   decisions were made.  It should describe alternate designs that
   were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported
   in other languages.

   The rationale should provide evidence of consensus within the
   community and discuss important objections or concerns raised
   during discussion.

7. Backwards Compatibility -- All PSEPs that introduce backwards
   incompatibilities must include a section describing these
   incompatibilities and their severity.  The PSEP must explain how the
   author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities.  PSEP
   submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise
   may be rejected outright.

8. Reference Implementation -- The reference implementation must be
   completed before any PSEP is given status "Final", but it need not
   be completed before the PSEP is accepted.  It is better to finish
   the specification and rationale first and reach consensus on it
   before writing code.

   The final implementation must include test code and documentation
   appropriate for either the PySide API reference or the respective
   generator tool reference.


PSEP Formats and Templates
==========================

As opposed to PEP, there is only one PSEP format available to authors:
reStructuredText_.  ReStructuredText_ PSEPs allow for rich markup that
is still quite easy to read, but results in much better-looking and more
functional HTML.  PSEP 12 contains instructions and a template [4]_ for
reStructuredText PSEPs.

There is a Python script that converts PSEPs to HTML for
viewing on the web [5]_.  reStructuredText PSEPs are parsed
and converted by Docutils_ code called from the script.


PSEP Header Preamble
====================

Each PSEP must begin with an RFC 822 style header preamble.  The headers
must appear in the following order.  Headers marked with "*" are
optional and are described below.  All other headers are required. ::

    PSEP: <psep number>
    Title: <psep title>
    Last-Modified: <svn date string>
    Author: <list of authors' real names and optionally, email addrs>
  * Discussions-To: <email address>
    Status: <Draft | Active | Accepted | Deferred | Rejected |
             Withdrawn | Final | Replaced>
    Type: <Standards Track | Informational | Process>
  * Content-Type: <text/plain | text/x-rst>
  * Requires: <psep numbers>
    Created: <date created on, in dd-mmm-yyyy format>
  * Python-Version: <version number>
    Post-History: <dates of postings to python-list and python-dev>
  * Replaces: <psep number>
  * Replaced-By: <psep number>

The Author header lists the names, and optionally the email addresses
of all the authors/owners of the PSEP.  The format of the Author header
value must be

    Random J. User <address@dom.ain>

if the email address is included, and just

    Random J. User

if the address is not given.  New PSEPs must use the mandated format
above.

If there are multiple authors, each should be on a separate line
following RFC 2822 continuation line conventions.  Note that personal
email addresses in PSEPs will be obscured as a defense against spam
harvesters.

While a PSEP is in private discussions (usually during the initial
Draft phase), a Discussions-To header will indicate the mailing list
or URL where the PSEP is being discussed.  No Discussions-To header is
necessary if the PSEP is being discussed privately with the author, or
on the pyside@lists.openbossa.org mailing list.  Note that email
addresses in the Discussions-To header will not be obscured.

The Type header specifies the type of PSEP: Standards Track,
Informational, or Process.

The format of a PSEP is specified with a Content-Type header.  The only
acceptable values is "text/x-rst" for reStructuredText PSEPs (see PSEP
12 [4]_).

The Created header records the date that the PSEP was assigned a
number, while Post-History is used to record the dates of when new
versions of the PSEP are posted to python-list and/or python-dev.  Both
headers should be in dd-mmm-yyyy format, e.g. 14-Aug-2001.

TODO: How should we deal with different Python, Qt, and PySide versions?

*Standards Track PSEPs must have a Python-Version header which indicates
the version of Python that the feature will be released with.
Informational and Process PSEPs do not need a Python-Version header.*

PSEPs may have a Requires header, indicating the PSEP numbers that this
PSEP depends on.

PSEPs may also have a Replaced-By header indicating that a PSEP has been
rendered obsolete by a later document; the value is the number of the
PSEP that replaces the current document.  The newer PSEP must have a
Replaces header containing the number of the PSEP that it rendered
obsolete.


Auxiliary Files
===============

PSEPs may include auxiliary files such as diagrams.  Such files must be
named ``psep-XXXX-Y.ext``, where "XXXX" is the PSEP number, "Y" is a
serial number (starting at 1), and "ext" is replaced by the actual
file extension (e.g. "png").


Reporting PSEP Bugs, or Submitting PSEP Updates
===============================================

How you report a bug, or submit a PSEP update depends on several
factors, such as the maturity of the PSEP, the preferences of the PSEP
author, and the nature of your comments.  For the early draft stages
of the PSEP, it's probably best to send your comments and changes
directly to the PSEP author.  For more mature, or finished PSEPs you may
want to submit corrections to the PySide `issue tracker`_ so that your
changes don't get lost.  If the PSEP author is a PySide developer, assign the
bug/patch to him, otherwise assign it to the PSEP editor.

When in doubt about where to send your changes, please check first
with the PSEP author and/or PSEP editor.

PSEP authors who have write permissions to the Gitorious repository can
push the changes to the repository themselves.

Transferring PSEP Ownership
===========================

It occasionally becomes necessary to transfer ownership of PSEPs to a
new champion.  In general, we'd like to retain the original author as
a co-author of the transferred PSEP, but that's really up to the
original author.  A good reason to transfer ownership is because the
original author no longer has the time or interest in updating it or
following through with the PSEP process, or has fallen off the face of
the 'net (i.e. is unreachable or not responding to email).  A bad
reason to transfer ownership is because you don't agree with the
direction of the PSEP.  We try to build consensus around a PSEP, but if
that's not possible, you can always submit a competing PSEP.

If you are interested in assuming ownership of a PSEP, send a message
asking to take over, addressed to both the original author and the PSEP
editor <pyside@lists.openbossa.org>.  If the original author doesn't respond to
email in a timely manner, the PSEP editor will make a unilateral
decision (it's not like such decisions can't be reversed :).


PSEP Editor Responsibilities & Workflow
=======================================

A PSEP editor must subscribe to the <pyside@lists.openbossa.org> list.  All
PSEP-related correspondence should be sent (or CC'd) to
<pyside@lists.openbossa.org> (but please do not cross-post!).

For each new PSEP that comes in an editor does the following:

* Read the PSEP to check if it is ready: sound and complete.  The ideas
  must make technical sense, even if they don't seem likely to be
  accepted.

* The title should accurately describe the content.

* Edit the PSEP for language (spelling, grammar, sentence structure,
  etc.), markup (for reST PSEPs), code style (examples should match PSEP
  8 & 7).

If the PSEP isn't ready, the editor will send it back to the author for
revision, with specific instructions.

Once the PSEP is ready for the repository, the PSEP editor will:

* Assign a PSEP number (almost always just the next available number,
  but sometimes it's a special/joke number, like 666 or 3141).

* List the PSEP in PSEP 0 (in two places: the categorized list, and the
  numeric list).

* Add the PSEP to the Git repository. To clone a copy of the Git
  repository, see `the PySide Gitorious page
  <http://qt.gitorious.org/pyside>`_.

* Monitor python.org to make sure the PSEP gets added to the site
  properly.

* Send email back to the PSEP author with next steps (post to
  pyside@lists.openbossa.org).

Updates to existing PSEPs also come in to pyside@lists.openbossa.org.
Alternatively, Gitorious merge requests may be made directly.

Many PSEPs are written and maintained by developers with write access to
the PySide repository.  The PSEP editors monitor the repository PSEP
changes, and correct any structure, grammar, spelling, or markup
mistakes we see.

The editors don't pass judgement on PSEPs.  We merely do the
administrative & editorial part.  Except for times like this, there's
relatively low volume.
