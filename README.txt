reStructuredText for PEPs
=========================

Original PEP source may be written using two standard formats, a
mildly idiomatic plaintext format and the reStructuredText format
(also, technically plaintext).  These two formats are described in PEP
9 and PEP 12 respectively.  The pep2html.py processing and
installation script knows how to produce the HTML for either PEP
format.  A local copy of the Docutils package is included for
processing reStructuredText PEPs.

Please report any problems or questions to
docutils-develop@lists.sourceforge.net or to David Goodger
(goodger@python.org).
