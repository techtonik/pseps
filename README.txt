reStructuredText for PSEPs
==========================

Original PSEP source should be written using the reStructuredText format
(technically plaintext).  This format is described in PSEP 12.
The pep2html.py processing and installation script knows how to produce the
HTML for the PSEP files.  A local copy of the Docutils package is included
for processing reStructuredText PSEPs.
